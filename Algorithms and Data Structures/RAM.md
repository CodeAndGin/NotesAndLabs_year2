# The Random Access Machine #
## Motivation ##
- Model for real computers

## Definition ##

A random access machine is a computer with:
- an unbounded amount of memory
	* addressable by integers
	* each memory access takes a constant time step
- a program made up of simple instructons
	* excecuted one-at-a-time
	* each simple instruction takes a constant time step
- program combinations using functions, loops, conditionals

### Running time ###

The number of constant time steps taken
- memory access
- simple instructions excecuted
- combinations excecuted

### Space used ###

The number of memory locations used
- in addition to the space used by the input: "additional space used"
